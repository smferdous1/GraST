# GraST

GrasT is a C++ implementation of some streaming graph algorithms. Currently, GraST implements two graph problems: 1) approximate maximum weight matching and 2) approximate minimum weight edge cover. GraST supports two ways to simulate streams: 1) edge read one by one from a matrix market (MTX) format file, which is used to report memory and overall runtime performance, and 2) read all the edges from a file (only support mtx format for now) and then stream from memory, which is used to compare the algorithmic time to the offline algorithms. Please see the following paper for details on the implementation and results for streaming matching and edge cover. Also, if you use GraST, please cite this paper.

  ## Description
  The src directory contains the implementation of the streaming matching, edge covering, and few auxiliary algorithms. The [StreamMatch.cc](./src/StreamMatch.cc) source file implements two semi-streaming matching algorithms: The $\frac{1}{2+\epsilon}$ Paz and Swartzman [2], and the $1/6$-approximate due to Feigenbaum et al [1]. The [StreamEC.cc](src/StreamEC.cc) file has the implementation of three new streaming edge cover algorithm. See the detailed description of these algorithms in
    
 ## Compilation
 1. Clone the GrasT github repo
    `git clone https://github.com/smferdous1/GraST-copy.git` 
 2.  Create a build directory and change current directory to the build one: `mkdir -p build && cd build`
 3. Generate the make files: `cmake ..`
 4. Generate the binaries: `make`
 
 This should create several binaries in the `build/apps` directory.  The **stmatch** and **stec** are the two binaries that can be used to execte the streaming matching and edge covering algorithms, respectively. Executing these binaires with **-h** flag provides with detailed description of the usage.
